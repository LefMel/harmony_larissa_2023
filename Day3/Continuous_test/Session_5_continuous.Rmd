# What type of test (Se,Sp) does this picture describe?

# On the other hand this picture describes a test with poor discriminatory ability, right?

![](figs/bad_test.png)

---

# The following picture describes the most usual setting.

Let's start building our hands-on example.

In the next slide we'll see a histogram of the values of a continuous test result (e.g. ELISA measuring antibodies), on the logarithmic scale.

---

---

Assuming the infectious status of each individual known we can plot/add the distributions of the diseased and healthy.

---
Drawing vertical lines *Se* and *Sp* can be estimated.

## ROC Analysis

- ROC curves represent a plot of all possible pairs of *Se* and *(1-Sp)* values estimated at a range of cut-off values.

- ROC can used to assess the accuracy of diagnostic tests measured on a continuous scales.

- The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of the overall discriminatory ability (diagnostic accuracy) of a test and generally ranges between 0.5 and 1. 
    * Low: 0.5 - AUC - 0.7
    *	Medium: 0.7 - AUC - 0.9 
    * High: 0.9 - AUC - 1 
    * Perfect: 1
    

# ROC Analysis with BLCMs 

---

## Point 1

- In the absence of a gold standard the true disease status of each individual is unknown.

- The available information we have is the continuous test output from each individual.

---

![](figs/histogram_unknown.png)

---

## Point 2

- Most studies dichotomize the continuous test output based on a pre-selected cut-off value and apply the BLCMs we discussed yesterday.

- But this results in loss of valuable information. 
  * All positive results are equal, no matter how near or far they are from the cutoff.
  
---

## Model Specification - Mixture Normal Model

- The data are best described by a mixture of two normal distributions:

	* D (-) individuals with mean (mu1) and variance (1/tau_1)
	* D (+) individuals with mean (mu2) and variance (1/tau_2)
	  * 1/tau = Precision
	
* The disease status for each indivudual is indicated by a latent variable.

* For identifiability we assume: *mu1 < mu2*
    - Diseased individuals are expected to have higher value of the continuous marker

---

## Mixture Normal Model explained

``` {r, include=FALSE}
continuous_test <- c("model {
  for (i in 1:481) {
	    #S[i] diagnostic test value for ith individual
	    S[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i],tau[i])
  
	    #Value of mu & tau depending on the group (diseased or disease-free)
	    mu[i] <- lambda[T[i]]           
	    tau[i] <- gamma[T[i]]
	    #dcat <- categorical #D(-) if T[i]=1, D(+) if T[i]=2
	    T[i] ~ dcat(P[]) 
  }
	P[1:2] ~ ddirch(alpha[])

	# lambda[1]-gamma[1] mean-precision of non-disease group   
	lambda[1] ~ dnorm(0,0.001)
	lambda[2] ~ dnorm(0,0.001)T(lambda[1],) 
	gamma[1] ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001)
	gamma[2] ~ dgamma(0.001,0.001)  

	# variance = 1/precision(tau)
	sigma[1] <- 1/gamma[1] 	
	sigma[2] <- 1/gamma[2]	

	# AUC
	AUC <- phi(-(lambda[1]-lambda[2])/sqrt(sigma[2]+sigma[1]))
	# ROC curve
	for(i in 1:111) {
	  c1[i] <-  ((-8.1+0.1*i)-lambda[2])/sqrt(sigma[2]) # grid is from -3 to 8
	  se[i] <- 1-phi(c1[i])
    c2[i] <-  ((-8.1+0.1*i)-lambda[1])/sqrt(sigma[1])
	  sp[i] <- phi(c2[i])
	  
	  Y[i] <- se[i] + sp[i] - 1
	}

```{r}
summary(S)
```

Define initial values:
```{r}
lambda <- list(chain1=c(-3, 0), chain2=c(-2,-2))
gamma <- list(chain1=c(10, 0.1), chain2=c(30, 5))
```


---

```{r, warning=TRUE}
results <- run.jags('cont_test.txt', n.chains = 2)
```

```{r}
#plot(results, vars=c('AUC', 'P', 'lambda', 'gamma', 'sigma'))
```

```{r}
results_summary <- add.summary(results, vars=c('AUC', 'P', 'lambda', 'gamma', 'sigma'))
```

---

```{r}
se_est <- combine.mcmc(results, vars='se')
sp_est <- combine.mcmc(results, vars='sp')
ses_mu <- apply(se_est, 2, mean)
sps_mu <- apply(sp_est, 2, mean)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot((1-sps_mu), ses_mu, type="l", col="darkblue", xlab = "1-Sp", ylab = "Se")
```

---

```{r}
auc_est <- combine.mcmc(results, vars='AUC')
hist(auc_est, breaks=50, col="orange", main="AUC")
```

---

```{r}
lambda_est <- combine.mcmc(results, vars='lambda')
boxplot(as.matrix(lambda_est), col="red")
```

---

## Conclusion - Remarks

- Normality assumption?

- Distance between the D(-) and D(+) distributions

- Label switching

- More complicated settings 
  * Correlated tests
  * Multiple populations
  * More than 2 infectious stages
  * etc...

---

## Exercises

- Run the model and produce the same output.

- Try to run the model under different prior specification for lambda

- What happens if you remove T(lambda[1],)? Does the model converge?

- Try and find the cut-off value that maximizes Youden's index?

---

## Another approach

```{r}
# Another option in JAGS is to use dnormmix:
# S[i] ~ dnormmix(mu[1:2], tau[1:2], P[1:2])
# This is more efficient than explicitly simulating the latent class
#modules# mix
#factories# mix::TemperedMix sampler off
##### /Alternative
```
